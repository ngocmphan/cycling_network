# Biking Network Analysis

## Topic
The project aims to explore the cycling infrastructure network of municipalities with focus on accessibility, income level influence or inequality and safety. 

## Main questions
- Correlation between materials of bike paths and safety or comfort of cyclists. Consideration of materials and maintenance cost. 
- Correlation between type of infrastructure and income level by municipal.
- Bike paths accessibility and income level by municipal. 
- Accident rate for cyclist by municipal (with classification of infrastructure and materials). 

## Deliverables
- Visualisation of cycling network with color coded type of infrastructure based on Can-BISC. 
- Visualisations on cycling infrastructure (with comparison by municipality)
- Visualisations on other statistics relating to income level, accident rate, and correlations with cycling infrastucture characteristics.
